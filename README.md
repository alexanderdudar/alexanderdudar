# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alexander Dudar

I'm a Computer Engineering student at UBC with 4+ years of experience in software development, data analytics, and technical project management. My work spans full-stack applications, cloud infrastructure, and systems design with a focus on delivering real business and operational impact.

At **SAP Canada**, I worked as a Technical Project Manager Intern, leading technical coordination across 20+ engineering teams on the SAP Analytics Cloud platform. I built automated Excel models that saved SAC hiring teams up to 4 hours weekly, refactored internal tools used by 220+ employees, and developed a KPI dashboard for live operational tracking. My work directly improved developer workflows, hiring efficiency, and system migration planning.

Before that, I led UI/UX and web infrastructure at **The Best One Ltd.**, where I developed interactive 3D React.js tools, negotiated cloud service transitions that saved over \$5,500/month, and managed structural engineering and sustainability initiatives.

My personal and academic projects include:
- A **concurrent Java-based IoT server** with predictive analytics and actuator toggling
- A **geospatial social platform** using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Google Maps APIs
- A **stock options visualizer** using the Desmos API and real-time market data

Iâ€™m skilled in JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, MongoDB, React, Node.js, Excel (advanced), Git, and systems design. I thrive at the intersection of engineering and business, where I translate complex requirements into scalable, high-impact solutions.
